## Options

After setting up the integration, you can configure it further in Settings :material-arrow-right: Devices & Services :material-arrow-right: myVAILLANT :material-arrow-right: Configure.

### Seconds between scans

:   Wait interval between updating (most) sensors. The energy data and efficiency sensors have a fixed hourly interval.
    Setting this too low can cause "quota exceeded" errors.
    
    :material-cog: Default is 60 seconds.

### Delay before refreshing data after updates

:   How long to wait between making a request (i.e. setting target temperature) and refreshing data.
    The Vaillant API takes some time to return the updated values. Setting this too low will return the old values.
    
    :material-cog: Default is 5 seconds.

### Default duration in hours for quick veto

:   When setting the temperature with the climate controls, the integration uses the "quick veto" feature of the myVAILLANT
    app by default.
    
    With this option you can set for how long the temperature should stay set, before returning to the default value.

    :material-cog: Default is 3 hours.

### Default duration in days for away mode

:   When the away mode preset is activated, this duration is used to for the end date.

    :material-cog: Default is 365 days.

### Default temperature setpoint for away mode

:   When away mode is activated without a temperature (for example with the away mode switch), this value is set for all zones.

    :material-cog: Default is 10.0Â°C.

### Temperature controls overwrite time program instead of setting quick veto

:   When raising or lowering the desired temperature in the myVAILLANT app, it sets a quick veto mode for a limited time
    with that new temperature, if the zone is in time controlled mode. If you want to permanently change the desired
    temperature, you need to update the time schedule.

    By default, this integration has the same behavior. But when enabling this option, the Home Assistant climate controls
    instead overwrite the temperatures set in the time schedule with the new value.

    :material-cog: Default is off.

    !!! note
    
        If quick veto is active, the climate controls will always set the quick veto temperature.

### Country

:   The country you registered your myVAILLANT account in. The list of options is limited to known supported countries.

### Brand

:   Brand of your HVAC equipment and app, pick Saunier Duval if you use the MiGo Link app.

## Known Issues

### Lack of Test Data for Different Systems

Your HVAC system might differ from the ones in [Tested Setups](#tested-setups) above.
If you don't see any entities, or get an error during setup, please check [Debugging](3-contributing.md#debugging) and
create an issue.
With debugging enabled, there's a chance to find the culprit in the data returned by the myVAILLANT API and fix it.

### Vaillant API is occasionally unavailable

The API this integration uses sometimes goes down. Before reporting an issue, check if the myVAILLANT app works normally.
If it doesn't, there's nothing we can do about it.

### Some features that are available on the controller or in the maintenance settings are not available

If you would like to request a new feature, please check that it's available in the myVAILLANT app first.
Some data (for example quiet mode or legionella protection) are not available in the app, and therefore
can't be supported by this integration.

### The modes in Home Assistant and the myVAILLANT app don't match

[Check the mapping of modes](2-entities.md#climate-entities) between Home Assistant and myVAILLANT.
